# 2022-Do

Just another exercise, the classic learner's app â€“ to-do.

Taking my time and focusing more on the coding logic than the usability etc.

E.g. spent all of today working out how to sort the entries by strict chronological date order. None of the 'new Date()'-style methods seemed to be working (the dates are strings in my noobish array of objects). Plenty of resources online pointing to various other libraries etc, but one hero on Stack Overflow said something to the effect of 'a good exercise would be to write a function that parses the dates for yourself'.

#### Next up (Friday 13-5-22): adding the ability to create a new entry and auto-sorting that within the array.
